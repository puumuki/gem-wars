### Prototypes ###

We are trying to create a game here. So before ours starting enthusiasm dry up we have to set some goals that keep up motivated. Some kind milestones on the road that leads us to Victory and Glory.

So what a propose is that we start making a first prototype of the game. We set the prototype requirements and implement them and when we are achieved. Then we check what we should do differently and what we should keep on the next prototype.

This is something that is called prototyping... or something. :)

Here is proposal for the first prototype:

# Gemwars Prototype No 1 - Requirements #
| **ID** | **Requirement** | **Importance** |
